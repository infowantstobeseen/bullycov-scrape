# MSState COVID Dashboard

This is a simple scraper for the [Mississippi State University COVID-19 Campus Testing site](https://www.msstate.edu/covid19/campus-testing "Latest COVID-19 Campus Testing") that tracks the last few weeks into a simple JSON file for use by anyone. I'm using it for my simple MSState Bully Dashboard, but anyone case use it.

## Usage

Run the Python3 script; it will add to any previous `bullycov.json` file you already have.

## Acknowledgments

[HTML Scraping](https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/scrape/ "HTML Scraping") from [The Hitchhicker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/guide-book "HGtP by Reitz & Schlusser") was very helpful in crafting the scraper.
